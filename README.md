The project is a model implemented and completed on the MATLAB Simulation program to research how to manage and distribute electrical energy in a vehicle whose engine derives energy from several sources available in the vehicle. The first source: a set of lithium batteries. The second source: a set of solar cells that charge the battery with a maximum capacity of 500 watts. The third source: a fuel cell with a maximum capacity of 6000 watts. Knowing that the vehicle's engine operates with a maximum capacity of 5000 watts and a maximum torque of 50 N.M and a maximum number of revolutions of 3000 rpm and the maximum speed of the vehicle is 60 km/h. The energy that feeds the engine is managed and distributed according to a fuzzy logic controller that can be modified and developed and was chosen on a driving cycle related to the subject of the accelerator pedal for a period of 25 seconds and with several external conditions for the amount of temperature, solar radiation and the initial charge of the battery. A script was prepared to draw energy source distribution diagrams and energy consumption for the engine. The article link is available for those who wish to view it
